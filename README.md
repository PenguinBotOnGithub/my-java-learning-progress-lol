# my-java-learning-progress-lol

And yeah going to SMK RUS motivated me to create this

I forgot one of the reasons why i hate Github is that i have to use personal access tokens

I wish i can make more than 5 repositories in Gitea

I'm using [www.learnjavaonline.org](https://www.learnjavaonline.org/) for the tutorial btw
